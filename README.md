Welcome
_______
Android Res Resize is a script that will allow you to automatically process
your android project's xhdpi drawables into hdpi, mdpi and ldpi resources.

Assuming you point this script at the xhdpi directory the script will
go over every png and jpg, and scale them down to hdpi, mdpi and ldpi.
The script will sort these images to their proper locations as well.

Example
_______
Point the script at "res/drawables", which the script assumes contains
your xhdpi images.
Should your folder for the lower quality images not exist, the script
will create the folders for you. You will end up with:

* res/drawables/
* res/drawables-hdpi/
* res/drawables-mdpi/
* res/drawables-ldpi/

Usage
_____

$ python android-res-resize.py --folder ~/MyProject/res/drawables-xhdpi
